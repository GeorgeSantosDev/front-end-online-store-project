<h1>Front-end online store</h1>

<p>
  Front-end online store was an application developed during the Trybe fullstack course (in group). The objective of this project is to build a simplified   version of an online store. Initially the project would be developed using class components, react and react router dom. However, the application was     refactored using functional components and context API, making the code cleaner and more readable, in addition to avoiding prop drilling. During         development the group used tools such as kanban, slack and scrum methodologies for agile development.
