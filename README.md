<h1>Front-end online store</h1>

<p>
    Front-end online store is a simplified version of an online store. Initially the project was developed in group using class components, react and 
    react router dom. I refactored using functional components and context API, making the code cleaner and more readable, in addition to avoiding prop 
    drilling. During development the group used tools such as kanban, slack and scrum methodologies for agile development.
</p>

<p>
  The code developed by all group is available in this branch: https://github.com/GeorgeSantosDev/front-end-online-store-project/tree/code-developed-by-the-group
</p>
<p>
    This was the first software development project I worked on as a group. I was able to develop skills such as communication, collaboration, active 
    listening and team work.
</p>
    
<p>
   The application was deployed with Vercel.
